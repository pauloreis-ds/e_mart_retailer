## Context

In other words, all of this indicates that customers are engaged and we can focus on acquiring more customers to increase revenue, because we know there is potential for repurchases.

**Revenue Growth Rate**

    How fast are We growing?


**Number of Orders**

    What is our ability to generate purchasing opportunities?
    

**Repurchase Rate**

    How many customers continue to buy?
    

**Number of New Customers**

    Tracking Customer Acquisition. Is our Marketing Strategy 
    (organic or not) working?
    

**Average Order Value**

    Average amount of money a customer spends per transaction. 
    It’s a key KPI because it helps measure how well We capitalize on cross-selling and
    upselling opportunities.
    
    Increasing average order value is one of the most efficient ways to increase ecommerce
    revenue. And, generally, the higher the AOV, the more We can spend to acquire a new customer.
    
    
**Average Profit**

    The more profit We can get out of a customer, the more We can afford to spend on acquiring 
    a customer or even reinvesting in other areas of the company.. 

    “For example, if each customer on average is worth 1,000 to you, you can afford to spend 
    anything below 1,000 to be profitable. Whereas if a competitor’s average profit per customer
    is only 200, they can’t spend anything above 200, but you can because each customer is worth more.”


**Profit Margin**

    It Measures The Profitability Of A Business
