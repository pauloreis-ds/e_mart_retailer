## Preventing Customer Churn


Customer Retention indicates whether the product and the quality of service please existing customers. In order to retain customers, E-Mart aims to predict which customer is going to stop buying.

Data Products asked:

- **A list of customer IDs and their probability of churn.**

- **What's the model performance in predicting customer churn?**

- **What's the monetary return the model will bring?**

- **What's Customers Churn Rate?**

- **A Dashboard to keep track of Customer Churn and Model's Performance.**



- **What's Customers Churn Rate?**

        14.29%
        
        
- **What is the model's performance in classifying customers as churn?**

        
        The model is estimated to detect 46% of customers who will actually churn.
        And 70% of customers identified as churn will be an actual churn case. 
        This 70% precision means: for each 100 churn alerts the model creates 70 of them will,
        in fact, churn.


- **What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company uses this model to avoid customer churn?**

        Estimated Annual Retained Revenue is $ 183,237.50
